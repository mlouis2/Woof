WOOF!



Summary:
It can sometimes be easy to forget to take care of yourself, especially when youâ€™re used to a busy daily schedule. WOOF! is an app that gives motivation to take care of yourself and have fun while doing it. For each meal you eat or glass of water you drink, you feed the same amount to a virtual dog, whose mood changes based on how well you are taking care of him. The satisfaction that comes with making your dog happy encourages you to also look after yourself.

This project was built for AthenaHacks 2019 by Maddie Louis (Computer Science), Merissa Tan (Computer Science), and Kaitlyn Behrens (Animation).
